# Traffic Light Simulator from Hyperskill

This project is created to help those beginners who chose the "Traffic Light Simulator" project for themselves and want to understand the logic of the code for the project.  
Idea and tasks for this project I took [here](https://hyperskill.org/projects/288).    

## Attention!
The logic of the code is not adapted, modified or refined. This code is responsible for exactly those tasks that were set by the [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/projects/288) site, where I got the idea from.

## Code explanation
This repo includes all the project files, along with Gradle files and tests written by the Hyperskill team, so that readers of the repository do not get confused by the files when adding their results to their repositories.    
The code I wrote for the task is in the direction [here](https://github.com/fallestlaww/Readability_Hyperskill/tree/main/Readability%20Score%20(Java)%20(1)/task/src/readability).    
Writed tests by Hyperskill, if you need this, - [here](https://github.com/fallestlaww/Readability_Hyperskill/tree/main/Readability%20Score%20(Java)%20(1)/task/test).    
All explanation of this code provided in the code comments for each function and each class.    

## Ending

As for me, there is no point in adding more code, but if you want - you have every right to do so, if you find bugs - let me know, I will be happy to fix everything.
